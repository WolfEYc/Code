               For example, if the neighbors of vertex 2 were listed as 3, 1, 6, 
               then that would be an unsorted neighbor list. It would need to be 1, 3, then 6.
            3. The graph must be connected.
            4. The graph must contain exactly one source node, i.e. exactly one node with an in-degree of 0. Note that this node/vertex
                need not be node 0.
            5. The graph must contain exactly one sink node, i.e. exactly one node with an out-degree of 0.
