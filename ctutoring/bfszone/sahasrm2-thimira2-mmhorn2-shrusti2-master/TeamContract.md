Team Meetings:
For this final project, to handle the communications aspect of this project our team will meet around two times a week to discussion our progress with the project. Each meeting will last anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour. We will also be planning on using zoom to hold these meetings. We will have someone take notes about our progress with the project at each of these meeting though that person may change depending on the meeting.

Assistance:
Outside of the meetings that are going to be held we will also be planning on having a groupme to communicate. We should expect a response from any other group member at the latest by about 5-6 hours from the original question.

Respect:
To make sure that each person is given an opportinity to be an active member of our group we will try to have each person tell the rest of the group of their progress during the weekly meetings. This time will allow other members to listen to each others progress with the project and if any people have any suggestions of how to improve the project that time will also be allocated for those suggestions.


Work Distribution:
We will discuss beforehand how to split up the groupwork and will have people say which parts they would prefer to work on a justify who should work on what part from that. To try and avoide being setback by any unexpected complications we will try to schedule our work in a timely fashion that will allow us to be on track each week but also give us some leway incase we do end up getting a little behind.

Time Commitment:
For each team member they should be expected to work around 5-6 hours a week on the assignment this will also give time allocated to any issues that we not expected to come across beforehand such as debugging. If new conflicts do appear we can try to change our goal of the project if need be. Otherwise we might have to have other group members try to help whoever is having an issue in order to be on track.

Conflict Resolution:
In order to resolve disagreements between groupmembers there will be time allocated for members to give their sides as to why they think what they think about the issue and after everyone has spoken, the majority vote will be considered as how the group will proceed.
